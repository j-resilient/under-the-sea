# under-the-sea
First project from the P1xt Python guide: a static website with an ocean theme.
My first real HTML/CSS project.

# Project Specs
From P1xt's [Get Job Ready - Python Edition] (https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-python-edition.md):
>Project: Pick a template from here, here or here and implement the frontend of a website with it as your inspiration (do not use its assets)

# Results
I chose [this template] (https://www.os-templates.com/free-website-templates/gleblu)
and recreated the main page using only HTML and CSS. I did not look at the source
code.

# What I Learned
- The basics of using git and git hub from beginning to end of a project
- CSS grid
- CSS flexbox
- More about semantic HTML
- How to write a README

# Credits
- [I used this template as inspiration] (https://www.os-templates.com/free-website-templates/gleblu)
- [The color palette I used] (https://www.colourlovers.com/palette/4624585/under_the_sea) (and I borrowed the name)
- [I got my pictures from pexel] (https://www.pexels.com/search/ocean/)
