#REMEMBER
[] Add media queries so that it changes sizes properly
[] Pick fonts
[] Make color change transition slowly back to original color
    when hover ends [navbar].
[] Fix gap between DROPDOWN and LINK TEXT.

#THINGS I'VE LEARNED
  If you don't set a fixed height, when the dropdown menu
  drops down the colors of the header will come with it.
